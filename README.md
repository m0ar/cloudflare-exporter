## Description

Prometheus exporter exposing Cloudflare Analytics dashboard data on a per-zone basis, as well as Worker metrics.
The exporter is also able to scrape Zone metrics by Colocations (https://www.cloudflare.com/network/).

## Grafana Dashboard

Our public dashboard is available at https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13133

## Helm chart repository

To deploy the exporter into Kubernetes, we recommend to use our manager Helm repository at

```
helm repo add cloudflare-exporter https://lablabs.github.io/cloudflare-exporter/
helm install cloudflare-exporter/cloudflare-exporter
```

## Configuration

The exporter can be configured using env variables

| **KEY** | **description** |
|-|-|
| `LISTEN` |  listen on addr:port ( default :8080), omit addr to listen on all interfaces |
| `METRICS_PATH` |  path for metrics, default /metrics |
| `CF_API_KEY` |  API key |
| `CF_API_EMAIL` |  email associated with the API key (https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Managing-API-Tokens-and-Keys) |
| `CF_API_TOKEN` |  API authentification token (https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/api-token-auth) |
| `ZONE_<NAME>` |  DEPRECATED (optional) Zone ID. Add zones you want to scrape by adding env vars in this format. You can find the zone ids in Cloudflare dashboards. |
| `CF_ZONES` |  (Optional) cloudflare zones to export, comma delimited list of zone ids, if not set, all zones from account are exported |
Defaults to all zones. |

Another configuration options are command line flags, same as environmental variables but lowercase, zones are not supported as flag, see ./cloudflare_exporter --help

```
  -cf_api_email="": cloudflare api email, works with api_key flag
  -cf_api_key="": cloudflare api key, works with api_email flag
  -cf_api_token="": cloudflare api token (preferred)
  -cf_zones="": cloudflare zones to export, comma delimited list
  -listen=":8080": listen on addr:port ( default :8080), omit addr to listen on all interfaces
  -metrics_path="/metrics": path for metrics, default /metrics
  -scrape_delay=300: scrape delay in seconds, defaults to 300
```

### Changes in in version 0.0.5+

## Authentication

From version 0.0.5 onward authentication using Bearer token is supported. Authentication using API key and email will continue working in later versions as well. The token authentication method is preferred.

## Zone filtering

The original method of zone filtering by using env variables `ZONE_<name>` is now deprecated. Zones can be filtered by using `CF_ZONES` env variable and setting the value as list of zones separated by a comma (CF_ZONES=zone1,zone2,zone3).
